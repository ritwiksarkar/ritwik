				Vote for Thought was a collaborative project of mine with fellow students from my MA program, focused on exploring the apathetic nature
				between students and student unions at Newcastle University. The project was aimed at finding out answers to questions that hadn’t been raised, 
				and in doing so, explore the reasons for detachment.<br><br>

					<h2>Why Vote for Thought?</h2>
					<div style="margin:20px; padding:4px">
					<p>Politics and discontent is applicable to a student and their university, as it is to working adults 
					and their governments. For an outsider to the system, like me, I wanted to see wether an organised political system at the university
					level was really a representative student body, or whether it only chose to represent students of a particular disposition.</p>

	
					
					<h2>Multimedia Focus</h2>
					<p>Rather than just pasting walls of text, one after another, we decided to integrate more multimedia aspects, to give our target audience
					(the students of the university) the ability to easily consume information. This involved interviewing the student community as well as 
					representatives in a variety of different ways.</p>

					<br>
					<p>I conducted both interviews with the then head of the Newcastle University Students Union, as well as hosting a panel discussion with concerned teachers and students</p>

					<h2> Curating Student Responses </h2>
					<p>What was imperative to the project was zero-ing in on why students chose to 
					speak out against the system, and why their feelings towards them. These responses were too three different political movements— The UK General Elections, The Newcastle <a href="http://vote4thought.weebly.com/council-elections.html">Council Elections</a> and the <a href="http://vote4thought.weebly.com/referendum.html">NUS Referendum. </a></p>

					<p>Using platforms of <a href="https://youtu.be/ri0rpLqIY44">vox pops</a>, <a href="http://vote4thought.weebly.com/council-elections.html">on-line surveys</a> as well as <a href="http://vote4thought.weebly.com/matthew-busby">case study interviews</a>, we gauged the impetus and exercise of political will throughout the youth of newcastle, both students and residents.</p>
